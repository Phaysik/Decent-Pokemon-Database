This started as a project that I started as a means to learn jQuery and Bootstrap but quickly turned into a passion project that has consumed a lot of my time. Honestly without this project, I never would have experimented with Node, JSON, Databases (implementation not currently on a branch) and external JS libraries.

## Important

Since this project relies on AJAX requests to gather information, you must locally host this project. Confirmed working on Node's 'http-server', Python's 'python -m http.server', and PHP's 'php -S localhost:port'

For future reference (or depending on the branch cloned), the data may not show. This will be due to how it will retrieve information from a localhosted database. Due to the database being hosted locally, the cloned project / repository will not be able to access the data. If I remember, I will try and add some clauses and methods to default to JSON loading if there SQL query fails.
